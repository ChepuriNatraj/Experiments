# Experiments

A collection of practical projects that solve real problems I've encountered. No fluff, just code that works.

## What This Repository Is About

I'm someone who values organization. When I find myself doing repetitive tasks or facing annoying problems, I write code to solve them. This repository is where I share those solutions.

These aren't polished products or complex frameworks. They're straightforward tools that get specific jobs done. If you're looking for clean, practical code that solves real-world problems, you're in the right place.

## Why I Built This

Organization matters. Time matters. When I encounter a problem that code can solve, I solve it. Then I share it here in case someone else has the same problem.

Each project in this repository exists because I needed it. The code is written to be understood and modified. If it helps you, use it. If you can improve it, let me know.

## Projects

### EPUB to PDF Converter
A text-focused converter for ebooks. Built it because I was tired of online converters and needed clean text extraction for working with LLMs.

**Tech**: Python  
**Use case**: Converting downloaded ebooks to PDF format for personal use and text analysis.

### Money Manager
A personal expense tracking application. Built it because I couldn't track how my money was being spent and needed better budget management.

**Tech**: React + TypeScript  
**Use case**: Track daily expenses, manage budget using 50-30-20 rule, visualize spending patterns.  
**Built with**: AI-assisted development (Claude Sonnet 3.5)

## Upcoming Projects

This repository will grow as I solve more problems. Expect projects related to:
- File organization and automation
- Data processing and cleanup
- Workflow optimization
- Text manipulation and analysis
- System automation
- AI-assisted development experiments

All focused on making life more organized and efficient.

## Philosophy

- Write code that solves real problems
- Keep it simple and readable
- Document what matters
- Share what works
- Improve based on feedback
- Experiment with new technologies (including AI)

## Using These Projects

Each project has its own README with installation and usage instructions. Clone what you need, modify it for your use case, and let me know if you find bugs or have suggestions.

## Contributing

Found an issue? Have a better approach? Open an issue or submit a pull request. I'm always interested in better solutions.

## License

Open source. Use it, modify it, share it. Just respect copyright laws when applicable (especially with content converters).

Built with various technologies. Maintained when needed. Shared because organization should be accessible to everyone.
